# assembly-playground
Collection of exercises and small programs written in x86-64 Assembly (GAS syntax). Used to practice low-level programming concepts such as memory addressing, registers, loops, and system calls. Clean, minimal, and educational — a personal sandbox for exploring how computers really work.
